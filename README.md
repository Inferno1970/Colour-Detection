# Real-Time Color Detection

## Overview
This project demonstrates real-time color detection using OpenCV. The script captures video from the camera, detects a specified color in each frame, and draws bounding boxes around the detected color regions.

## Installation
Ensure you have the required libraries installed. You can install them using pip:

```bash
pip install opencv-python-headless pillow numpy
